We’re here to create a safer, happier and more mindful future for all with the help of data science, engineering, design, and mobile technology. We're starting by reinventing insurance, by rethinking the technologies that enable it, but our true goal is to build a platform that rewards people for driving well — creating safer roads with fewer accidents in the process.

Backed by impressive funding, we're poised to re-engineer a trillion-dollar category, and that’s just the beginning. We’re using rich customer insights, advanced technology and data science to build our cloud-native InsurTech solution, and other things we haven’t even dreamt up yet. We're out to change behavior and promote mindful living at a societal level. But the key to us being successful in our mission isn’t just about nailing the technology—it’s about hiring the talented people who can help us make a quantifiable impact in the world. We’re growing our world-class team. And that’s where you come in.

The data science team builds the data-driven features of the company.
Requirements for all data scientists

Expert in Python and core libraries used by data scientists (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc.)
Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large or fast moving data sets
Qualified for one of the the specializations below
Specialization: Machine Learning
Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. Very likely you read Wes’ book. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Modern techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern data: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.
Specialization: Marketing
Statistical rigor: You should have a solid foundation of the statistics behind standard statistical design methods such as A/B testing and multivariate testing. For example, you should know how to deal with clustering and should be able to determine the standard errors of different statistics through simulation.
Multi-armed bandit models: You know how to implement the technique and how to write a good cost function.
Modern techniques: You can build a model that powers an app that serves a unique arrangement of diverse components to each user such that the specific components served were chosen to maximize the specific user’s probability of selecting a call to action (i.e. using machine learning to identify complex heterogenous treatment effects).
War stories: You must be able to talk about times you ran experiments in a complex environment and what you learned from the effort
Specific experience in marketing optimization is a plus.
Specialization: Insurance
Industry experience: You have solid P&C experience and have had a significant role in building either pricing or underwriting models.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",Data Scientist,"San Francisco, CA",4.3,₹1 to ₹5 billion (INR),$119K-$187K (Glassdoor Est.),Information Technology,51 to 200 employees,Company - Private
